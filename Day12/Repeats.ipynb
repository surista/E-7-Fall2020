    "\n",
    "Repeats complicate the task of sequencing the genome, which is done by piecing together short subsequences. \n",
    "If the repeat is longer than the typical subsequence, it is difficult to know which copy of a repeat a sequence preceeds or follows.  \n",

    "Given a string 'text', we are looking for a tripple t = (length, pos1, pos2) such that pos1 != pos2 and\n",
